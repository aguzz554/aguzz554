# Agustin Gonzalez

**Fullstack & DevOps Engineer | Software Architect | Entrepreneur from Uruguay 🇺🇾**

19-year-old engineer building scalable, AI-powered platforms that solve real problems. I specialize in designing resilient systems from concept to production, combining modern web technologies with cloud infrastructure and intelligent automation.

## What I Do

I architect and build end-to-end solutions with a focus on reliability, performance, and user experience. My work spans:

- **Backend Engineering**: Node.js, Golang, Java, .NET — building robust APIs and microservices
- **Frontend Development**: Next.js, React, TypeScript — crafting intuitive, responsive interfaces
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS (ECS, Lambda, CloudFront, S3, CloudWatch) — designing auto-scaling, cost-optimized architectures
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API, LangChain, Vision models — embedding intelligence into products
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Docker, automated pipelines — ensuring smooth deployments

I'm meticulous about security (TLS 1.2+, JWT, WAF), observability (CloudWatch metrics), and creating systems that scale efficiently from hundreds to thousands of users.

## Current Focus

Building AI-driven platforms that combine cutting-edge technology with real business value. I'm passionate about real estate tech, intelligent automation, and creating products that improve how people interact with data and services.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not architecting systems, I'm training (fitness enthusiast), learning languages (fluent English 🇬🇧, learning Italian 🇮🇹), or exploring new tech. I believe in discipline, continuous learning, and building with purpose.

**Let's connect**: Always open to discussing architecture, AI, cloud infrastructure, or collaborating on meaningful projects.
